# Hi, I'm Paul Peytevin 

## About Me

I'm a Machine Learning & Data Science student at **CentraleSupélec (Université Paris-Saclay)**, currently part of the elite **Digital Tech Year** program. I work on real-world AI prototypes through intensive industry sprints at the **Paris Digital Lab**.

I enjoy designing intelligent systems from **RAG pipelines** and **NLP applications** to **full‑stack AI tools**. I love building things end‑to‑end and turning ideas into working solutions.

📍 **Currently looking for a 6‑month Machine Learning / Data Science internship starting March 2026**, ideally in an international and innovation‑driven environment.
